# HousePrices_Regression
In this project, I attempted to predict housing prices in California using machine learning techniques for regression analysis. The dataset used comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices. I compared the efficacy of two models: Multiple linear regression and Random forest regression. Random forest was selected as it had lower RMSE scores and higher R2 correlation coefficient during model selection. The model was then optimized with parameter tuning to output a final score of 44738 in RMSE and 0.79 in R2 score. The most important feature extracted from the model is reported to be median income.
